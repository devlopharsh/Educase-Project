# 📝 Project Submission: React JS Assignment

Hello,

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this assignment. I’ve created a responsive and clean **React JS** project based on the requirements you provided.

## 📁 Project Structure

All the major pages are located inside the `pages/` folder:

- `Welcome.jsx`
- `Signup.jsx`
- `Signin.jsx`
- `SettingsPanel.jsx`

## 🎨 Styling

The entire UI is built using **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring a modern and responsive design across all screen sizes.

I’ve carefully followed the instructions and recreated the layout exactly as provided in the reference files. I hope the results meet your expectations and reflect the attention to detail and code quality you’re looking for.

Thank you once again for the opportunity. I’m looking forward to your feedback!

Best regards,  
**Harsh Kumar**
